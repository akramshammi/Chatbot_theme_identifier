# Chatbot_theme_identifier

 It focuses on building an AI-powered system that identifies themes from chatbot responses using NLP and classification techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Chatbot Theme Identifier uses natural language processing to classify chatbot conversations into predefined thematic categories. It applies TF-IDF vectorization and ensemble machine learning models to accurately label responses.

This solution aims to automate the thematic analysis of chatbot conversations and can be extended to support more advanced document-level theme identification using retrieval-based or LLM-powered methods.

## 🔍 Features

- TF-IDF-based feature extraction  
- Ensemble ML models for robust theme classification  
- Preprocessing of user-bot conversation data  
- Scalable and modular codebase for experimentation  
- Ready for future integration with LangChain, OpenAI, or RAG-based theme synthesis
